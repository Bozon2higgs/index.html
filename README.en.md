# HFH — Human For Human

HFH (Human For Human) is a simple, secure, local-first tool designed to structure facts related to human rights violations, without data collection, servers, or automatic transmission.

HFH is a tool.  
It is not a platform, an organization, or an authority.

## Purpose

To enable anyone to put sensitive facts into a clear and structured form, including in constrained contexts such as stress, urgency, surveillance, or limited connectivity.

HFH does not interpret, judge, or transmit any information.

## Core principles

- no data collection  
- no storage  
- no transmission  
- no backend  
- no user accounts  
- no cookies or analytics  

Everything runs locally in the browser.

## Features

- guided structured form  
- local PDF export  
- local editable DOCX export  
- multilingual interface

## Security and privacy

Entered data never leaves the user’s device.

HFH can be used offline after loading and via networks such as Tor.

HFH does not guarantee the security of exported documents.

## Responsible use

HFH is a tool designed to help structure facts.

It does not provide legal, technical, or operational protection.

The user remains solely responsible for:
- the accuracy of the information entered,
- the use, sharing, or transmission of generated documents,
- assessing the risks associated with their disclosure.

HFH does not store any data and has no way of knowing how the tool is used.

Before sharing, users are encouraged to carefully assess the context and potential consequences.

## What HFH is not

HFH is not:
- a reporting service,
- a transmission service,
- a platform,
- an investigation or verification tool.

HFH only helps structure facts.

## Intentionally excluded features

Some features are intentionally not included in HFH.

Any function involving data transmission, storage, verification, or centralization would conflict with the core purpose of the project.

HFH is designed to remain a simple, local, and non-intrusive tool.

## Checklist before use or sharing

Before using or sharing a document generated with HFH:
- verify the accuracy of the entered information,
- assess risks related to context and recipient,
- ensure the chosen transmission method is appropriate.

HFH does not intervene in these decisions.

## Project status

HFH is stable, functional, and ready for version 1.0.

The project may be released, frozen, or extended gradually, without urgency.

## Minimal legal notice
