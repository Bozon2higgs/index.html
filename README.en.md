# HFH — Human For Human

HFH (Human For Human) is a simple, secure, local-first tool designed to structure reports of human rights violations without data collection, servers, or automatic transmission.

HFH is a tool.  
It is not a platform, an organization, or an authority.

HFH does not interpret, judge, or transmit information.

## Security and privacy

All data remains on the user’s device.

## What HFH is not

HFH is not a reporting platform, a transmission service, or an investigation tool.

It only helps structure information.

## Project status

HFH is stable, functional, and ready for version 1.0.
## Responsible use

HFH is a tool designed to help structure information.

It does not provide legal, technical, or operational protection.

The user remains solely responsible for:
- the accuracy of the information entered,
- how the generated documents are used, shared, or transmitted,
- assessing the risks associated with their disclosure.

HFH does not store any data and has no way of knowing how the tool is used.

Before sharing any document, users are encouraged to carefully assess the context and potential consequences.
